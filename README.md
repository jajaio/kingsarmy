# King's Army
King's army is an RPG on for the UNIX command line.

# Swordsman and Archer edition
Experience the game from two perspectives! One from a swordsman, and
one from an archer. You travel to different places in each version.

# Status
Not finished. Swordsman edition is almost done, and I've yet to start
the programming for Archer edition. More updates within the following
weeks.
