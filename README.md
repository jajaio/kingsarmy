# King's Army
King's army is an RPG on for the UNIX command line.

# Swordsman and Archer edition
Experience the game from two perspectives! One from a swordsman, and
one from an archer. You travel to different places in each version.

It's been a while since I've been working on this project. I need to
add just a bit more to swordsman edition, and work more on archer
edition. Since I've been out of school, I've been pretty lazy on
any programming projects. I assume more will be added whenever I have
the drive to work.
